# Tic Tac Toe Game (Java Console App)

This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java. The project primarily focuses on implementing the game's logic, allowing players to play against a computer opponent.

## Features

- Console-based interface
- Player vs. Computer gameplay
- Validates user inputs and places marks on the board
- Determines game over scenarios (player wins, computer wins, or a tie)

## How to Play

- The game board is represented by numbers from 1 to 9.
- The player chooses a position by inputting a number from 1 to 9.
- If the selected position is valid (empty on the board), the player's mark 'X' is placed there.
- The computer opponent randomly selects an available position and marks it with 'O'.
- The game continues until either a player wins, the computer wins, or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac TicTacToe.java`.
3. Run the compiled program with `java TicTacToe`.

## File Structure
